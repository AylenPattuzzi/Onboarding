Check out and keep as a reference [Classy Django REST Framework](http://www.cdrf.co/)

## 4. Authentication
- [x] Investigate about JWT
- [x] Check out and keep as a reference [DRF Authentication](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/).

- [x] Implement email verification for new users.

## 5. DRF Testing
Read the following resources:
- [x] [DRF Testing](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing).
- [x] [How to Develop APIs with Django REST Framework](https://djangostars.com/blog/rest-apis-django-development/) is a DRF tutorial that covers topics already seen but using a TDD. It has useful examples of testing and documenting in DFR.
- [x] [Testing for Django Rest Framework with Factory Bot and Faker](https://ruddra.com/posts/tdd-drf-factory-boy-faker/).

Implement unit tests in your tutorial's application.
- [x] Implement tests for the models.
- [x] Implement tests for the API.

## 6. Design the "moovie" API
Take a look at this [diagram]( https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oecuuhaecnH4TNOpXp3Q8St0PQ6Am2L0) (open it with StarUML):

Based on that model, design an API that supports the following operations:

Movies:
- [x] List movies (supporting paging, filtering, and sorting).
- [x] Get movie.

Lists:
- [x] Get user lists.
- [x] Create list.
- [x] Get list.
- [x] Update list.
- [x] Delete list.
- [x] Add movie to list.
- [x] Remove movie from list.

Genres:
- [x] Get genres.

User profile:
- [x] Get user profile.
- [x] Update user profile.
- [x] Upload user photo.
- [x] Remove user photo.

For each one of the above operations, you should specify:
- HTTP method.
- HTTP path.
- path parameters.
- query parameters parameters.
- Possible HTTP response codes.
- Success response schema.
- Error response schema.

NOTE: Don't design for authentication / authorization in mind. These topics will be covered later.
